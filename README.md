### Hey there!
- ðŸ‘‹ ... Iâ€™m 0fie
- ðŸ‘€ I'm fascinated by NixOS, a Linux distribution built on Nix, a powerful package manager known for its unique capabilities like atomic upgrades, effortless rollbacks, and guaranteeing reproducible builds through a purely functional approach. The entire ecosystem surrounding NixOS is equally intriguing to me.
- ðŸ¦€ I'm also actively diving into Rust and TypeScript, fueled by a strong passion to contribute significantly to the open-source community in the future.
